# Point-M2AE: Multi-scale Masked Autoencoders for Hierarchical Point Cloud Pre-training
Official implementation of ['Point-M2AE: Multi-scale Masked Autoencoders for Hierarchical Point Cloud Pre-training'](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14401.pdf).

The paper has been accepted by **NeurIPS 2022**.

## Introduction
Point-M2AE is a strong **M**ulti-scale **M**AE pre-training framework for hierarchical self-supervised learning of 3D point clouds. Unlike the standard transformer in MAE, we modify the encoder and decoder into pyramid architectures to progressively model spatial geometries and capture both fine-grained and high-level semantics of 3D shapes. We design a multi-scale masking strategy to generate consistent visible regions across scales, and reconstruct the masked coordinates from a global-to-local perspective.
